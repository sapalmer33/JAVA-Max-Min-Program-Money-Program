# JAVA-Max-Min-Program-Money-Program

Max/Min Program
In the first part of this program (Max/Min), the program will ask the user for 10 values. The user will then input his/her selected values which will activate the program after the tenth value. Once the values have been entered, the program then determines the maximum value entered and the minimum value entered. After determining these two values, the program then computes the average for all the values entered. This average will be displayed as a floating-point number. After determining each of these functions, these values are printed out at the bottom of the code. Each value holds a descriptive label. Instead of the program reading each integer individually, it uses a loop which allows the program to decipher the max, min, and average while the user is entering their values. 
The output of the following program is below: 

Enter ten integers between 1 and 100, and I will tell you the
smallest, the largest, and the average:
56
47
21
3
10
8
77
41
9
34
Smallest: 3
Largest: 77
Average: 30.6



Calculator Program
In the second part of this program (Calculator), the program operates as a cash register. It prompts the user for a quantity of money. This number will be represented as a floating-point number. Once the program recognizes this number, it then computes each dollar, half-dollar, quarter, dime, nickel, and penny (in that order) for the users quantity. 
The output of the following program is below: 

Please enter the total in dollars and cents (example: 1.25): 3.94
Dollars: 3
Half-dollars: 1
Quarters: 1
Dimes: 1
Nickels: 1
Pennies: 4
