# JAVA-Max-Min-Program-Money-Program

In the first part of this program (Max/Min), the program will ask the user for 10 values. The user will then input their selected values which will activate the program after the tenth value. Once they have been entered, the program then determines the maximum value entered and the minimum value entered. After determining these two values, the program then computes the average for all the values entered. This average will be displayed as a floating-point number. After determining each of these functions, these values are printed out at theb bottom of the code. Each value holds a descriptive label. Instead of the program reading each interger individually, it uses a loop which allows the program to desipher the max, min, and average while the user is entering their values.
